          You know those products and brands we love spending our money on? Did
          you know that when you purchase something from them you're basically
          investing in their company SO why not invest in their shares.

              Dividend Rewards
              <p>
                Some companies will give a share of their profits, called
                dividends, to their shareholders (that's you!) which can be used
                to buy more shares or be taken as a cash pay-out. Money for
                nothing!

              Shared Value Increase
              <p>
                When the company you have invested in grows and makes more
                profit, its value goes up. When you sell your share in the
                business, it's worth more than what you paid for it. You make
                moolah!
